# Lib-C Like Library Rubric

# Assembly-Based Lib-C Recreation Project

Welcome to the Assembly-Based Lib-C Recreation Project. This project is an ambitious endeavor to recreate the fundamental functions of the standard C library, libc, using assembly language.

The goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of low-level computing concepts and the inner workings of libc, a library that forms the core of many programs in Unix-like operating systems. By recreating libc functions in assembly, we will be working closer to the hardware, dealing with registers, memory management, and system calls directly.

This project will challenge your understanding of both C and assembly language, and will require a strong attention to detail. It's not just about making functions that work, but also about understanding and handling edge cases, and writing efficient, robust code.

We will start with basic functions, such as memory allocation and initialization, and gradually move on to more complex ones. Each function will be a journey into the heart of the computer, and by the end of this project, you will have a deeper understanding of how your programs run at the machine level.

Let's get started!

## Code Quality and Formatting

Check for proper error code handling, meaningful error messages, and consistent error handling practices.

## Function 1: Initialization

### Did the user implement the initialization function?

Users should have implemented an initialization function to set up the library.

```c
// Example Initialization Function
void initialize_library() {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

## Function 2: Memory Allocation

### Did the user implement a function for dynamic memory allocation?

Users should have created a function to dynamically allocate memory within the library.

```c
// Example Memory Allocation Function
void* allocate_memory(size_t size) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

## Function 3: String Manipulation

### Did the user implement a function for string manipulation?

Users should have included a function for string manipulation within the library.

```c
// Example String Manipulation Function
void manipulate_string(char* str) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

## Function 4: Error Handling

### Did the user implement proper error handling?

Users should have implemented error handling mechanisms to deal with unexpected situations.

```c
// Example Error Handling Function
void handle_error(int error_code) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

## Function 5: Cleanup

### Did the user implement a cleanup function?

Users should have implemented a cleanup function to free resources and perform necessary clean-up operations.

```c
// Example Cleanup Function
void cleanup_library() {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```
